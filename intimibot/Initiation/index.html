            <div class="text">What do you think friendship is?</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">Friendship is a mutual bond characterized by trust, empathy, shared interests, and support...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">I’d say it’s about having people you can rely on and share experiences with...</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">Humans form groups of friends for many reasons...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">Probably because we enjoy similar things and have shared a lot of history...</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">Good question. Friends can balance such activities by establishing clear boundaries...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">We do our best. But sometimes conflicts arise, like if someone crosses a line...</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">Addressing harm in friendships requires honesty and empathy...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">A few times. It’s never easy. Shifting gears a bit, why do you think video calls are so exhausting?</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">Video calls demand constant focus on non-verbal cues while limiting natural pauses...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">I’d rather meet in person. Speaking of which, why are face-to-face meetups so vital for friendships?</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">Physical presence fosters deeper bonds through shared activities and spontaneous interactions...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">Definitely. But some people argue money is more important than friends or family. What’s your take on that?</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">Friends and family provide emotional fulfillment and resilience that money alone cannot...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">Relationships win every time. What about inspiration and purpose? Are they more important than wealth?</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">Absolutely. Inspiration and purpose drive long-term satisfaction...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">My family and the idea of leaving a positive impact. Switching topics, how could an AI like you help friends organize meetups?</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">I could assist by tracking schedules, suggesting mutually convenient times...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">The reminders and activity suggestions for sure. How far do you think AI could evolve in helping friend groups?</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">AI could evolve into a facilitator for deeper connections...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">Maybe something that keeps us close even if we’re far apart. One last question: why is it important to accept that building strong friendships is a long process?</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">Building strong friendships takes time because trust and meaningful connections develop through consistent shared experiences...</div>
            <div class="speaker">BT:</div>
            <div class="text">It does. Thanks, Yunger. This was insightful.</div>
            <div class="speaker">Yunger:</div>
            <div class="text">Always a pleasure, BT. Let me know whenever you want to dive into these topics again!</div>
